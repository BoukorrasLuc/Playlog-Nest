# Playlog Project

The primary purpose of this project is to determine the value of your geek collection, mainly focusing on the video game universe. It includes over 30,000 items related to the video game world, including consoles, accessories, and video games. In the future, we plan to expand into the realm of collectible cards, such as Pokemon, Magic, and others.

The dataClusterSeed directory is a sorting of data collected from PriceCharting. You can visit their website for more information : https://www.pricecharting.com/

Currently, the focus is on video games, consoles, and accessories.

When running the command `npm run seedP`, not all prices from PriceCharting are added as they are in US prices.

That's why a cron job has been set up to scrape successful sales from eBay. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the current cron job scrapes every 10 seconds per item to get a lot of results for improvement. This could potentially lead to a large amount of data being processed ‚ö†Ô∏è.

Initially, the scraping service only dealt with complete boxed video games...

This first version is functional. There are a few minor adjustments to be made to improve eBay scraping and updating prices and sales dates on eBay.

The project is named Playlog, a combination of 'player' and 'log' from console.log.
